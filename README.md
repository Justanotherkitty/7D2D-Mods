Adds some wacky sounds and eventually some wacky models :)

### Installation
zcogmod is built for vanilla, but there's also an undead legacy version. you need both for some things to work with undead legacy \<currently nothing actually lol>

download the zips you need and extract them into your mods folder, and that's it!
